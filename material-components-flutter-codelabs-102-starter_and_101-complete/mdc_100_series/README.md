MDC-102 Flutter -Material Structure and Layout 

# Introduction 
This project is the second codelab in a series that demonstrates how to build an e-commerce app called Shrine using Flutterâ€™s Material Components (MDC).

# For Home.dart
This Flutter HomePage widget from MDC-102 showcases an e-commerce app screen using Material Design components. In Home.dart features an AppBar with a menu button, title, search, and filter icons. The product list is displayed in a responsive two-column GridView.count, where each item is represented as a Card containing an image, product name, and price. Product data is fetched from the ProductsRepository, and prices are formatted using the intl package. The layout follows Material Design principles with clean spacing, proper image scaling, and consistent typography, laying the foundation for further customization and theming in the next codelabs.

# For App.dart 
This Flutter ShrineApp widget is the main entry point of the Shrine e-commerce app, configured using the MaterialApp widget.  It defines two routes: the /login route, which loads the LoginPage, and the default / route, which loads the HomePage.


As conclusion,MDC-102 Flutter: Material Structure and Layout introduces key concepts for building structured and visually appealing user interfaces using Material Design in Flutter. By creating a home screen for the Shrine e-commerce app, you learned to implement a responsive grid list of product cards, design a top app bar with navigation and action buttons, and apply proper spacing and alignment. This codelab lays the foundation for more advanced customization, theming, and interaction, which are covered in subsequent codelabs, ensuring that your Flutter apps follow best practices in both design and functionality.
